    A book contains a unique collection of trades and the resultant positions. Since the focus in this case is

    the raw trades. For scenario testing, it is the book, that will need to ensure it applies the appropriate
    instrument life-cycle operations.

    of related assets. A position represent in a book is unique and will not be found in another book.
